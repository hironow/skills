"""Unit tests for scripts/readme_index.py (README blocks from frontmatter).

The skills README keeps its prose by hand; the blocks between the marker
comments are generated from each skill's frontmatter so they cannot drift:
the index (name, first sentence of the description, flags) and the credits
(derived skills with upstream repository, license, and what changed; the
skills whose origin is unconfirmed; the confirmed originals). A derived skill
that lacks the provenance contract is an error, never a blank cell.
